# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v7.0.0 (2023-12-12)

### Community change: Big news!

**We welcome Lorenzo Marnat ([Liris](https://liris.cnrs.fr/)) as a new maintainer!** The Liris has contributed a lot to py3dtiles through their fork and the client application `py3dtilers` and Lorenzo is currently helping getting these improvements merged. This is a very important step forward developing our community and we're very glad to have him in the team.

As a result, we have made it so that py3dtiles is less tied to Oslandia and more to its own community. We hope to make contributions and implications even easier and open to other entities:

- **the repository has moved to its own organization**: https://gitlab.com/py3dtiles/py3dtiles and the main branch is now `main` instead of `master`. The existing issues and merge requests has been kept and the branch they point to has been updated. **Please update your git remotes**, especially because there is no redirection at the git level: we needed to recreate the py3dtiles on oslandia namespace to setup a redirection from the old pages.
- **The main domain is now `https://py3dtiles.org`**. A redirection has been made, but we still advise everybody to update their bookmarks
- We have a `GOVERNANCE.md` documentation that describes how the community will operate from now on.
- and we now have a [chat room](https://matrix.to/#/#py3dtiles:matrix.org) on matrix.org!

### BREAKING CHANGE

- `FeatureTable*` has been renamed to `PntsFeatureTable*`
- py3dtiles now requires numpy >= 1.24 to allow python 3.11 support (note: 3.12 support must wait for the next numba release)

Big change in the way we deal with dependencies. With more and more file format supports added, the dependency tree is becoming bigger and bigger. To avoid cluttering client environments with dependencies for formats they don't need, we are now using the `extras_require` section for some formats. Here is the list of file formats and the command to use to get the corresponding dependencies:

- postgresql support: `pip install py3dtiles[postgres]`
- las/laz support: `pip install py3dtiles[las]` (note: laz support is still conditioned by the presence of laszip or lasrs, see installation documentation)
- ply support: `pip install py3dtiles[ply]`

The `.[all]` sections allows to get all these dependencies. The docker image contains everything.

Csv and xyz support depends on the standard library, therefore they are always included.

### Feat

- add support for python 3.11
- add featureTable and B3dmFeatureTable classes
- upgrade numpy
- support for csv files and classification data in the xyz_reader

### Fix

- **mypy**: make type declarations compatible with python3.8
- **convert.py**: ensure the main process waits for all child to finish
- align b3dm_feature_table to 8 bytes
- Pnts from_file method to ensure TileContent is  PNTS
- PNTS ft body to_array returns one array
- **distance.py**: remove a numba warning
- **docker**: create it on bullseye to have liblaszip8

### Refactor

- **convert.py**: change self.idle_clients type to set
- reorder imports according to our isort config
- rename PNTS FeatureTable classes

## v6.0.0 (2023-04-04)

### BREAKING CHANGE

- the `queue` argument is removed from reader `run` method signatures (these functions do not send messages anymore)
- The method `sync` of the `PntsBody` and `B3dmBody` has been moved to `TileContent` class. The parameter `body` has been removed.
- The `Pnts.from_feature` method signature has completely changed. Numpy data type isn't used anymore but a `FeatureTableHeader`
- The attributes:
  - `B3dm.from_glTF` has been renamed to `B3dm.from_gltf`
  - `B3dmBody.from_glTF` has been renamed to `B3dmBody.from_gltf`

  - The `FeatureTable.feature` method has been renamed to `get_feature_at` and return tuple instead of Feature instance
  - The signature of `FeatureTable.from_features` has completely changed. Numpy data type isn't anymore use,

- add the import and export of batch table from pnts (only json)
- **reader/ply_reader.py**: support .ply files
- **typing.py**: create the tileset json structure with typing annotations

## v4.0.0 (2023-01-09)

### BREAKING CHANGE

- The parameter `srs_in` and `srs_out` of `py3dtiles.convert.convert` have been
renamed to `crs_in` and `crs_out`. Furthermore, their type is no longer int
or str but `pyproj.CRS`. No change has been made to the command-line `py3dtiles convert`, but you can use proj4 string in addition to epsg code. To migrate old code, instead of:
```python
from py3dtiles.convert import convert
# ...
convert('without_srs.las', outfolder=tmp_dir, crs_out='4978')
```
you can do:
```python
from pyproj import CRS
from py3dtiles.convert import convert
# ...
convert('without_srs.las', outfolder=tmp_dir, crs_out=CRS.from_epsg(4978))
```
- SrsInMissingException has been moved from `py3dtiles/utils.py` to `py3dtiles/exceptions.py`.

### Feat

The main feature of this release is that you can now mix las/laz/xyz files in one invocation of the convert function.

### Fix

- **shared_node_store.py**: fix node removing in cache if already deleted
- change srs_in to srs_out to fix refactoring error
- avoid duplicate points when the mode is replace

### Refactor

- **convert**: rename the 'infos' variable and function to 'file_info'
- **convert**: use CRS almost everywhere instead of string representing epsg code
- **exceptions**: move all custom exceptions at the same place
- **convert**: use a dictionary to find the correct reader
- fix issues find by pre-commit

### Chores

- add pre-commit hooks

## v3.0.0

### BREAKING

Some renaming has been done to better follow the 3dtiles specification:

- `TileHeader` -> `TileContentHeader`
- `TileBody` -> `TileContentBody`
- The API of merger.py::merge wasn't really convenient to use and has now changed. Now the signature is:
```python3
def merge(folder: Union[str, Path], overwrite: bool = False, verbose: int = 0) -> None
```
- the argument verbose of the cli interface has changed. To increase the verbosity, the number of -v is counted (-vv will be a verbose of 2).
- Boolean options has been changed from `--foo=1` to simple flags: `--foo`. Affected options are `--overwrite` and `--graph`.
- `--rgb=no` has been replaced by a `--no-rgb` option to deactivate it. The default is still to keep color information

### Features

- support laz if laszip is installed
- windows support (NOTE: testers needed)
- Some classes to represent 3Dtiles concepts have been added:
	- BoundingVolumeBox
	- TileSet
	- Tile
	- uExtension

### Fix

- The geometric error of two merged tilesets is now the biggest of the two tileset geometric error divided by the ratio of kept points. We believe this use of GeometricError fits more the spirit of the specification.
- **node**: avoid empty children array in tileset.json
- **setup.py**: fix missing dependency pytest
- **node**: avoid to add empty children array
- disable padding if already 8-byte aligned instead of adding 8 new empty bytes
- **featureTable**: add a 8-byte boundary for FeatureTableBody
- **featureTable**: change the boundary from 4 to 8
- replace sys.exit(1) in convert by raising an exception

## v2.0.0

This releases completely reworks py3dtiles command line and add new features.

The command line now uses subcommands syntax, in order to expose a single
entry point and support multiple commands. The existing commands 'export_tileset' and 'py3dtiles_info' became
'py3dtiles export' and 'py3dtiles info'.

### Changes

- relicensed as Apache 2.0.
- minimal python supported is now 3.8
- dependencies versions has been updated:
    - laspy should be at least 2.0
    - numpy at least 1.20.0
- Tile has been renamed to TileContent

### Features

New features were added, the main one being: py3dtiles can be used to convert
pointcloud las files to a 3dtiles tileset.

This is the purpose of the 'py3dtiles convert' command. It supports multicore
processor for faster processing, leveraging pyzmq, and the memory management has been carefully
implemented to support virtually unlimited points count.

Other features:

- read points from xyz files
- Documentation are now published at https://oslandia.gitlab.io/py3dtiles

### Fixes

* 53580ba Jeremy Gaillard       fix: use y-up orientation for glTF objects in export script
* 65d6f67 Jeremy Gaillard       fix: proper bounding box size in export script
* 3603b00 Augustin Trancart     fix: reliably select triangulation projection plane and orientation
